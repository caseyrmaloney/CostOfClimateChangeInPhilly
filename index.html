                <p> Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns. These shifts may be
                    natural,
                    such as through variations in the solar cycle.
                    But since the 1800s, human activities have been the main driver of climate change, primarily due to
                    burning
                    fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas. </p>

                    Burning fossil fuels generates greenhouse gas emissions that act like a blanket wrapped around the
                    Earth,
                    trapping the suns heat and raising temperatures.

        <p>Greenhouse gas concentrations are at their highest levels in 2 million years
            And emissions continue to rise. As a result, the Earth is now about 1.1°C warmer than it was in the late
            1800s.
            The last decade (2011-2020) was the warmest on record.</p>

                    Many people think climate change mainly means warmer temperatures. But temperature rise is only the
                    beginning of the story.
                    Because the Earth is a system, where everything is connected, changes in one area can influence changes in
                    all others.

                    How does rising temperature Effect sea level?
                </h1>
        
                <p> A warming climate can cause seawater to expand and ice over land to melt, both of which can cause a rise in
                    sea level.

            <div>
                <p>
                    Sea level can rise by two different mechanisms with respect to climate change. First, as the oceans warm due
                    to an increasing global temperature,
                    seawater expands—taking up more space in the ocean basin and causing a rise in water level. The second
                    mechanism is the melting of ice over land, which then adds water to the ocean.

                <p> Philadelphia area waters could rise 19 inches by 2050, and 4 feet or more by 2100, putting nearly 2,000 homes and 3,200 people in Philadelphia at risk.</p>

                <p> Today, Pennsylvania has 7,000 people at risk of coastal flooding. By 2050, an additional 6,000 people are projected to be at risk due to sea level rise.</p>

                <p> Pennsylvania has the smallest proportion of its total area currently in the 100-year coastal floodplain. By 2050, the area is projected to double from 10 to more than 20 square miles.</p>
