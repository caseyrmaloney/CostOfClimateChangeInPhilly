At 8 p.m. EDT on the 14th, there were two low pressure systems, one in Kentucky and the other in western Alabama. The southern low pressure system became the predominate one overnight and at 8 a.m. EDT on the 15th, it (996 millibar low) was located in western North Carolina. As the 15th continued, it moved northeast and intensified rapidly. At 2 p.m. EDT the nor'easter (989 millibars) was near Raleigh, North Carolina. At 8 p.m. EDT, the nor'easter was a 979 millibar low pressure system near Virginia Beach, Virginia. Another low pressure system formed on its warm front during the afternoon over Chesapeake Bay and at 8 p.m. EDT it (982 millibars) was over extreme southwest New Jersey. The lows consolidated into one again overnight and a very intense 973 millibar low pressure system was located over Monmouth County, New Jersey at 2 a.m. EDT on the 16th. At 8 a.m. EDT on the 16th the nor'easter was down to 968 millibars and located over New York City. That was a drop in central pressure of 28 millibars in 24 hours which qualified it as a meteorological bomb (a drop in central pressure of at least 24 millibars in 24 hours) low pressure system. The nor'easter bottomed at a pressure of about 966 millibars (28.53 inches) at 11 a.m. EDT just south of Long Island, New York. To put into prospective how low the pressure was with this nor'easter, that central pressure is near the border of the pressure defined category 2 and category 3 hurricane once used on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. As the 16th continued, the nor'easter weakened and meandered across southwest New England and the New York and New Jersey coastal waters. By 2 a.m. EDT on the 17th, the nor'easter's central pressure rose to 988 millibars and a second storm formed on the triple point of its fronts south of Nova Scotia. This became the main low pressure system. The low pressure system then slowly moved southeast over the next couple of days. The heaviest precipitation fell as the low pressure system was rapidly intensifying on the 15th into the early part of the 16th.

The first surge occurred during bands of heavier rain during the evening of the 27th and early morning of the 28th. The second peak occurred during the afternoon of the 28th when skies were clearing and deeper mixing of the atmosphere brought stronger winds to the ground. Most of the peak wind gusts occurred at this time.

There were 425 roadways that were closed statewide due to the combination of downed trees, downed utilities and flooding.  There were 21 precautionary bridge closures awaiting inspection. The number of closed roadways dropped to 245 on November 1st,  141 on November 3rd, and 38 (mainly because of  downed utilities) on November 5th.  Trash and recycling schedules were delayed. Area hotels were booked solid as people without heat or that had home damage seeked shelter. There were also long gas lines because of problems with gas supplies in New York and New Jersey. Motorists were given two week extensions for their vehicle registrations and inspections that were due by the end of October. |  	|PECO Energy reported a record breaking 850,000 of its customers lost power.  Pennsylvania Power and Light reported 370,000 of its customers lost power and Metropolitan Edison reported 246,000 of its customers.  Statewide about 520,000 utility customers were still without power on November 1st. Power was fully restored to Pennsylvania Power and Light customers on November 4th, Metropolitan Edison the week of November 4th and PECO Energy on November 6th.  Power outages forced Carbon and Monroe Counties 911 operations to default to back-up and emergency powers. The high winds damaged four communication sites in Berks County. They were operating on reduced functionality but still maintained coverage throughout the county. ||In Berks County, a tree fell onto the porch of a home in Pike Township, and killed a 62 year-old man. Other deaths attributed to Sandy included: in Montgomery County, a 90-year-old female was found deceased in her apartment after being overcome by fumes from her generator in the garage below her living room, in Carbon County, a 66-year-old male died at hospital due to carbon monoxide poisoning from generator running in the garage, in Northampton County, a 17- year-old boy drove his ATV into a downed tree, a 67-year-old male in Lehigh Township was found on the evening of November 2nd, apparently ran over by his tractor while cleaning up from the storm, in Lehigh County an 86-year-old female from Orefield was found unresponsive in her yard and pronounced dead from hypothermia, another man in Lehigh County also died from exposure, a 48-year-old female was found deceased in her home in Lower Macungie Township after being overcome by fumes from generator in her garage, in Berks County, an 86-year-old man died from carbon monoxide poisoning and in Philadelphia a 95-year-old female died from an electrical malfunction shortly after power was restored and a 64-year-old female died from a fire. There were six direct or indirect reported injuries. An infant in Upper Darby (Delaware County) was injured when a tree fell through the house. In Levittiown (Bucks County), two children were also injured when a tree fell through their home.  Two people in Monroe County were hospitalized due to carbon monoxide poisoning and a firefighter was injured in Carbon County responding to the carbon monoxide fatality. ||Tropical Storm Sandy formed in the Caribbean Sea on the 22nd of October. After drifting slowly southwest into the 23rd, Sandy turned to the north and intensified to a hurricane on the 24th just before making landfall in Jamaica during that afternoon. Hurricane Sandy continued to the north and intensified to a strong category two hurricane before making landfall again in Cuba shortly after Midnight EDT on the 25th. Hurricane Sandy emerged on the other side of Cuba during the morning of the 25th and proceeded to drift northwest as a category one or two hurricane as it moved through the Bahamas on the 25th and 26th. Overnight on the 26th, Hurricane Sandy (Category 1) started to move toward the north-northeast, a motion that continued into the evening of the 28th. From there, Sandy���s motion became driven by two factors. An anomalously strong blocking ridge over the Canadian Maritimes prevented Sandy from escaping to the east. Simultaneously, an approaching and deepening extratropical trough was about to capture Sandy. The combination of the two, turned Sandy to the north overnight on the 28th and then to the northwest on the 29th. Hurricane Sandy received one last jolt of tropical energy as it passed across the Gulf Stream during the morning of the 29th. The lowest recorded central pressure of 940 millibars (27.76 inches) occurred when Category 1 Hurricane Sandy was about 110 miles southeast of Atlantic City at 2 p.m. EDT on the 29th. As Sandy continued to move northwest and interact with the mid latitude trough, its interaction continued to make it less tropical, but did not weaken it much. Sandy continued to make a harder turn to the left (west) and made landfall in Atlantic County as a post tropical storm in Brigantine City just north of Atlantic City at 730 p.m. EDT on the 29th. The estimated minimum central pressure was 945 millibars. The lowest recorded central pressure was 945.6 millibars at the Atlantic City Marina at 734 p.m. EDT. From there, Sandy continued to weaken or fill as it moved west. At 9 p.m. EDT, the low pressure system was in western Atlantic County and continued to move west-northwest. Sandy entered Pennsylvania in Delaware County around 1030 p.m. EDT. At 11 p.m. EDT, the post tropical storm (about 954 millibars) was located in southern Chester County. Post tropical storm Sandy continued to move west-northwest and weaken. At 2 a.m. EDT on the 30th, the 962 millibar low was located near Harrisburg, Pennsylvania and at 8 a.m. EDT the 979 millibar low was near Altoona, Pennsylvania. From there, the rapidly weakening low pressure system moved northwest and reached Lake Erie (993 millibars) at 8 p.m. EDT that evening and from there drifted north into Canada.|					|The unique aspect of Sandy and unlike most tropical systems was the multi-tide cycle increase of onshore winds prior to landfall. In Upper Delaware Bay and tidal sections of the Delaware River, some minor tidal flooding occurred during the evening high tide cycle on the 28th, moderate (upper Delaware Bay) and major (the tidal Delaware River) record breaking tidal flooding occurred during the one overnight high tide cycle on the 29th as Sandy moved westward. The storm surge averaged 4 to 5 feet. The region was spared higher surges as Sandy made landfall in New Jersey and the winds prior to landfall pushed water down the Delaware River and Delaware Bay. Borderline minor to moderate tidal flooding occurred during the subsequent daytime high tide cycle on the 30th. Minor tidal flooding occurred along tidal sections of the Delaware with the high tide cycle on the 31st. Tidal sections of the Delaware River were spared significant runoff from the non-tidal sections of the river as the heaviest rain occurred in the southern half of New Jersey.||Strong north to northeast winds associated with Sandy started to spread across the state during the morning of the 29th. High or damaging winds started during the middle of the afternoon on the 29th in the local Philadelphia area. High winds spread across the rest of Eastern Pennsylvania by the start of the evening.  Most of the peak wind gusts (between 60 mph and 80 mph) occurred during the middle evening hours of the 29th as Sandy was making landfall. The high winds were over by around Midnight EDT that night and as Sandy rapidly weakened. Except for the Poconos where it lingered until the morning, most of the strong wind gusts were also over shortly after Midnight EDT on the 30th. The highest measured wind gust in Mount Holly���s forecast and warning area in Pennsylvania was 81 mph in Allentown  (Lehigh County).  ||Heavy rain also occurred with Sandy in the southeast part of the state. This made it easier for shallow rooted and leafed trees to be uprooted, it also complicated the tidal flooding. Unlike some of the more recent tropical systems to affect the area, the heaviest rain fell south of the state of Pennsylvania.  Event rainfall totals averaged 1 to 2.5 inches in the Poconos, Lehigh Valley and Bucks County, 2.5 inches to 5 inches in Berks, Montgomery, Delaware and Philadelphia Counties and 4 to 6 inches in Chester County. The steady rain associated with Sandy started to spread into the state during the day on the 28th and slowly edged north and northeast and reached all of the state by the morning of the 29th. The heaviest rain fell during the morning and afternoon on the 29th.  The rain ended during the middle of the day on the 30th. | |In the city of Philadelphia, about 10,000 people were evacuated including the Eastwick Neighborhood. Approximately 100 trees were knocked down and about 140,000 PECO customers lost power.  Hundreds of events were cancelled or postponed.  Tidal flooding occurred along Delaware Avenue. The refineries within the city could not operate at full capacity because of power outages. Bucks County was one of the hardest hit counties in Eastern Pennsylvania with around 200,000 homes and businesses losing power. Thirty-eight roadways were closed due to wind damage with the most closures in Solebury Township. In Montgomery County, around 200,000 homes and businesses also lost power. The high winds destroyed one home in the county, caused major damage to sixteen others, minor damage to nineteen others and affected an additional twenty homes. The most road closures were in Upper Dublin Township while the hardest hit townships were East Norriton, West Norriton, Lower Providence, Upper Merion, Lower Merion and Whitpain. In Delaware County, a home in Newtown Square was badly damaged by a downed tree. About 86,000 homes and businesses lost power. In Chester County, three homes were damaged by downed trees in West Goshen Township. About 74,000 homes and businesses lost power.  Six roadways in the township were closed. Most of the worst wind damage occurred in the eastern part of the county in East Goshen, East Whiteland, Tredyffrin, Westtown and Easttown Townships.  County offices and Longwood Gardens reopened on the 31st. ||In Berks County, thirty-one roadways were closed. In the Lehigh Valley, 181,000 homes and businesses lost power. In Lehigh County, the high winds caused major damage to thirteen homes,  minor damage to thirty-two homes and affected an additional eighty-six homes. Flights were cancelled from Lehigh Valley International Airport on the 29th and through Noon EDT on the 30th. About 29 roads were closed. In neighboring Northampton County, thirty-two roadways were closed. In the Poconos, in Monroe County, the worst reported wind damage occurred in Lehman and Middle Smithfield Townships.  The Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area was closed. At the Pocono Raceway, the wind knocked down a steeple. Thirty-one roadways were closed. Carbon County fared better as only five roadways were closed.|  |Peak wind gusts included 81 mph in Allentown (Lehigh County), 77 mph in Forks Township (Northampton County), 76 mph in Bensalem (Bucks County), 70 mph at the Lehigh Valley International Airport, Northeast Philadelphia Airport and Bushkill (Northampton County), 68 mph in Perkasie (Bucks County) and the Philadelphia International Airport, 66 mph in Mount Pocono (Monroe County), 64 mph in Mount Aetna (Berks County), 62 mph in Wind Gap (Northampton County), 59 mph in Newbold (Bucks County), Pottstown (Montgomery County) and Newtown Square (Delaware County), 56 mph in Yardley, 48 mph in West Grove (Chester County), 46 mph in Reading (Berks County) and 45 mph in Coatesville (Chester County). ||In Philadelphia, the overnight high tide on the 29th reached a record breaking 10.62 feet above mean lower low water. The previous record was 10.5 feet above mean lower low water during a pair of nor���easters: April 17, 2011 and November 25, 1950.

Its associated strong cold front swept eastward through the Mid Atlantic region and across Pennsylvania during the early morning of the 21st. In addition, a secondary area of low pressure formed along the frontal boundary, west of Delaware Bay, and deepened rapidly. The approaching cold front and the deepening secondary low pressure produced a strong southeasterly flow the reached into the local Philadelphia area and resulted in peak wind gusts of around 50 mph in the far southeast part of the state and knocked down weak tree limbs and wires.  In addition, the significant southeast flow allowed water to pile up along the New Jersey shore and into the Delaware Bay and Delaware River and produced major tidal flooding.on the morning of the 21st. Lastly this southeast flow also brought moderate to heavy rain into the state with storm totals ranging between 1 to 3 inches. The rain began during the afternoon of the 20th and fell at its heaviest between Midnight EST and 6 a.m. EST on the 21st. The rain ended between 7 a.m. EST and 9 a.m. EST on the morning of the 21st. This rain resulted in poor drainage flooding as well as minor to moderate flooding of streams and creeks in Eastern Pennsylvania.| |In Philadelphia, the tidal flooding forced the closure of the southbound lanes of Interstate 95 at Columbus Boulevard. Columbus Boulevard/Delaware Avenue was flooded and closed in both directions between Washington and Fairmount Avenues.  In Bucks County,  tidal flooding affected the Radcliffe, Cedar and Mill Street areas of Bristol Township.
